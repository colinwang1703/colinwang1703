# About Me

## Introduction

Hello, I'm a student in Suzhou High School of Jiangsu Province in China with a passion for photography. I love capturing beautiful moments in life with my camera, whether it's the grandeur of nature or the small joys in everyday life.

## My Interests

I have a keen interest in programming, particularly in Python. I enjoy the logical thinking and problem-solving aspects of coding. I'm always excited to create something new and useful from just lines of code.

## Raspberry Pi Projects

In addition to photography and programming, I also love tinkering with Raspberry Pi. It's amazing how this small device can be used to build so many different projects. I've used it to build everything from home automation systems to game servers.

## Future Goals

As I continue my journey in middle school, I aim to further improve my programming skills and explore more advanced Raspberry Pi projects. I'm also looking forward to learning more about digital photography and image processing.

Thank you for taking the time to read my self-introduction. I'm excited to share my journey and learn from all of you!
